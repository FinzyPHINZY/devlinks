## How to Get Started

1. **Clone the repo**:  
   `git clone https://github.com/FinzyPHINZy/devlinks.git`
2. **Install dependencies**:  
   `pnpm install`

3. **Set up environment variables**:  
   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following:

   ```bash
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
   MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key

   Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual keys and URLs. These are essential for running the project locally.

   `pnpm dev`  
   and watch your DevLinks page come to life in your browser.

   Jump into the code and start adding your links. The UI is pretty straightforward, but the magic happens in your creativity.
